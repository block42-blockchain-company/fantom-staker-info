A dApp on the Fantom Opera network to browse information about its validators.

## Why

Fantom delegators have a hard time finding the right validators to delegator their FTM to. The community started some efforts to create more transparency and collect more information about validators but nothing was nice and easy to use. There also were issues keeping the data up-to-date because it was maintained in a centralized manner.

## How

By creating a [smart contract](https://github.com/block42-blockchain-company/fantom-staker-info/blob/master/smart-contract/contracts/StakerInfo.sol) that interacts with the [SFC smart contract](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/fantom-sfc/blob/master/contracts/sfc/Staker.sol). It allows each Fantom validators to add and update information (a URL to a `JSON` file) about themselves, so delegators have more insights who they are, without the involvement of a third party.
A small backend application continously fetches all the validator data (to take load off the clients) and a frontend application displays it to users and delegators in a nice way.

## What

The smart contract is already deployed and can be found on the Fantom Opera MainNet at the following address:

```solidity
0x92ffad75b8a942d149621a39502cdd8ad1dd57b4
```

### What it looks like

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6087393/72285334-30f08800-3643-11ea-9e68-de7dc54190cc.png)

Most of the information that is shown is fetched automatically, but there are a few parameters than can be set by validators.

### Config File

Create a config file in `JSON` format that contains the following parameters (you can also leave parameters empty):

```js
{
  "name": "VALIDATOR_NAME", /* Name of the validator */
  "logoUrl": "LOGO_URL", /* Validator logo */
  "website": "WEBSITE_URL", /* Website icon on the right */
  "contact": "CONTACT_URL" /* Contact icon on the right */
}

/* It could look something like this ðŸ‘‡ */

{
  "name": "block42",
  "logoUrl": "https://files.b42.tech/fantom/block42.png",
  "website": "https://block42.tech",
  "contact": "https://t.me/block42_fantom"
}
```

Then host it somewhere so it is publicly accessible!

### Update your validator info

1. Connect to your validator node
2. Open up a lachesis console session via `lachesis attach`
3. Load the StakerInfo contract ABI and instantiate the contract

```solidity
abi = JSON.parse('[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_stakerContractAddress","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"stakerID","type":"uint256"}],"name":"InfoUpdated","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"previousOwner","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"newOwner","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnershipTransferred","type":"event"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"isOwner","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"owner","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"renounceOwnership","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"stakerInfos","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"newOwner","type":"address"}],"name":"transferOwnership","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_stakerContractAddress","type":"address"}],"name":"updateStakerContractAddress","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"_configUrl","type":"string"}],"name":"updateInfo","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"_stakerID","type":"uint256"}],"name":"getInfo","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]')
stakerInfoContract = web3.ftm.contract(abi).at("0x92ffad75b8a942d149621a39502cdd8ad1dd57b4")
```

4. Call the `updateInfo` function of the StakerInfo contract (make sure you have enough FTM on your wallet to cover the transaction fee)

```solidity
stakerInfoContract.updateInfo("CONFIG_URL", { from: "VALIDATOR_ADDRESS" })
// e.g.: stakerInfoContract.updateInfo("https://files.b42.tech/fantom/config.json", { from: "0xa4ddde0afdaea05a3d5a2ec6b5c7f3fc9945020b" })
```

5. Validate if you updated your info correctly

```solidity
stakerInfoContract.getInfo(STAKER_ID)
// e.g.: stakerInfoContract.getInfo(14)
```
