A dApp on the Fantom Opera network to browse information about its validators.

## How does it work

We created a [smart contract](https://github.com/block42-blockchain-company/fantom-staker-info/blob/master/smart-contract/contracts/StakerInfo.sol) that interacts with the [SFC smart contract](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/fantom-sfc/blob/master/contracts/sfc/Staker.sol). It allows each Fantom validator to add information (a URL to a `JSON` file) about themselves, so delegators have more insights who they are, without the involvement of a third party.

## Usage

The smart contract is already deployed and can be found on the Fantom Opera MainNet:

```solidity
0x92ffad75b8a942d149621a39502cdd8ad1dd57b4
```

### Config File

Create a config file in `JSON` format that contains the following parameters (you can also leave parameters empty):

```json
{
  "name": "VALIDATOR_NAME",
  "website": "WEBSITE_URL",
  "contact": "CONTACT_URL",
  "keybasePubKey": "KEYBASE_64_BIT_PUBLIC_KEY",
  "logoUrl": "LOGO_URL",
  "description": "DESCRIPTION_TEXT"
}

// This is how it could look like ðŸ‘‡

{
  "name": "block42",
  "website": "https://block42.tech",
  "contact": "https://t.me/block42_fantom",
  "keybasePubKey": "C57B29418AE33CC0",
  "logoUrl": "https://files.b42.tech/fantom/block42.png",
  "description": "We invest into the most promising crypto ecosystems and help them secure their networks. We provide consulting and development services on top of those protocols to bring adoption and use to them."
}
```

Then host it somewhere so it is publicly accessible!

### Update your validator info

1. Connect to your validator node
2. Open up a lachesis console session via `lachesis attach`
3. Load the StakerInfo contract ABI and instantiate the contract

```solidity
abi = JSON.parse('[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_stakerContractAddress","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"stakerID","type":"uint256"}],"name":"InfoUpdated","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"previousOwner","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"newOwner","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnershipTransferred","type":"event"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"isOwner","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"owner","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"renounceOwnership","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"stakerInfos","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"newOwner","type":"address"}],"name":"transferOwnership","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"_stakerContractAddress","type":"address"}],"name":"updateStakerContractAddress","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"_configUrl","type":"string"}],"name":"updateInfo","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"_stakerID","type":"uint256"}],"name":"getInfo","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]')
stakerInfoContract = web3.ftm.contract(abi).at("0x92ffad75b8a942d149621a39502cdd8ad1dd57b4")
```

4. Call the `updateInfo` function of the StakerInfo contract (make sure you have enough FTM on your wallet to cover the transaction fee)

```solidity
stakerInfoContract.updateInfo("CONFIG_URL", { from: "VALIDATOR_ADDRESS" })
// e.g.: stakerInfoContract.updateInfo("https://files.b42.tech/fantom/config.json", { from: "0xa4ddde0afdaea05a3d5a2ec6b5c7f3fc9945020b" })
```

5. Validate if you updated your info correctly

```solidity
stakerInfoContract.getInfo(VALIDATOR_ID)
// e.g.: stakerInfoContract.getInfo(14)
```
